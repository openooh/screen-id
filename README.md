# screen-id
Proposals for how to identify screens

There are very few universal identifiers, though there are some common identifiers.

* Almost every publisher has one (or more) internal, publisher assigned ids they use to reference screens (or "places advertising can run")
* Some publishers or exchanges may identify using units other than screens (spots in loops, inventory groups, different sections of a screen)
* Some 3rd parties (e.g. GeoPath, COMMB, Route, etc.) assign IDs to screens

A draft is being prepared for public comment, tentatively scheduled for September 2021
